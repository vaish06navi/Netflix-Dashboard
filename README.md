# Description
The Netflix Data Analysis project utilizes Tableau to create interactive visualizations and dashboards based on the Netflix dataset. It provides insights into different aspects such as content distribution, genres, release dates, and ratings.

The project includes various visualizations to answer questions like:

- What are the most common genres in the Netflix library?
- How has the content distribution changed over the years?
- Which countries have the highest number of Netflix titles?
- What is the average rating of movies and TV shows on Netflix?

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset available on Kaggle. It contains information about various movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including attributes like title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, and more.
